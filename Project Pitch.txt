My project is an e-commerce site that aims to help people relieve their anger while creating financial assistance to local pet shelters.
People who are frustrated with others will come to the website to purchase animal excrement as pranking gifts, and the profit will go directly towards feeding the rescued animals. As a result, this give-and-take relationship creates a positive feedback loop. In addition, the website will also act as an advertisement space for rescues. There will be a ranking system based on the number of successful gift deliveries. The ranking system also directly correlates with the amount of time a rescue animal has spent in the shelter. Thus, older animal rescues will be shown first through the ranking system, which will increase their exposure and the likelihood of adoption. 
The project will be created as a mobile-friendly website to reach a large-scale audience. Additionally, the web format allows developers to easily implement interactive site components using Javascript. For example, a clicker game during the product quantity selection stage will drive more sales. Furthermore, an interactive site drives more web traffic.
This project was motivated by various gift pranking sites. For example, Cards Against Humanity sold thirty thousand poop boxes using the same method. However, the sole purpose of their event was to make money and nothing more. This concept of an e-commerce site aims to address this issue by focusing on the long-term beneficial relationships between the user and their local shelters. The goal is to create a supply and demand relationship to benefit both the people and animals.
